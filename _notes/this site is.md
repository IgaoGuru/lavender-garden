title: About this site
---


This site is powered by Jekyll, a static website generator. The site is served as a Netlify deployment based on my github repo. The site can read my notes written in markout down format and output it as html with minimal css.

It supports modern double bracket link syntax to other notes and it creates backlinks automatically. Yes, it functions like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). There is also link previews on hover and has an interactive graph visualization of all notes.

The site was developed by [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://maximevaillancourt.com/) and the source code is available as a[ github template repo](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) under MIT License.
