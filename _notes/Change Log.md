## What is this?
Change Log's function is to document how I have changed my approach towards using this public Zettelkasten system.

- March 10, 2023
	- Sub-domain no longer managed by cloud flare due to migration of personal site to wix
	- Started using [front matter](https://frontmatter.codes/) to manage SEO for the garden
	- Integrated open ai api to obsidian workflow - experiment AI powered note taking and learning workflows
	- PKM use has shifted from Obsidian to Logseq and now to Tana. Loving Tana so much, but tana lacks a mechanism to share notes externally. Hoping to see if an api comes out soon so that I can connect to tana to zettelgarden and create one seem less system

- **September 18, 2022**
	- This is a change note, that change log. I am not making any changes to the system, but I shifting the model to a new direction.
	- I have been reading Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain book quite deeply now, trying to further internalise it's core concepts and adapt it to my own use case. The case for PARA is quiet strong, when thinking in terms of actionablity and ease of capture. But his system lacks the larger allure and serendipity offered by Zettelkasten (or my intrepretation of what a Zettelkasten is) 
	- I am moving towards consolidating my knowledge base into three components all together - A private journal based on Logseq; A tiago style second brain using PARA for productive referencing; and the Zettelgarden which will morph into a true thinking box.
	- For Tiago's approach I might go with either Notion or Obsidian, once I figure which one is more intuitive to navigate under the PARA framework
	- For the Zettelgarden, I have to use obsidian by default cause of the way the site runs. But if Logseq makes more sence I do have the option to run a site that runs from a  logseq vault.



- **August 20, 2022 : Published the new home note structure**
	- New streamline home note released for the public
	- Slowly building a more consited writing and processing routine
	- Rediscoverability is an important touch point to cover in future iterations


- **August 8, 2022 : Major Changes to capture system**
	- Started rebuilding home note to shape into a better entry point (to be published)
	- Added readwise as a capture tool for personal database
	- Separated daily journals from personal database. Now I have a seperate logseq only database for personal journal entries and a obsidian/logseq combo for information capture
	- Started focusing streamlining note processing inside Zettelgarden vault


- **September 7, 2021 : Using Tags on the front matter**
	Though I used tags extensively to organise the "Zettlemind" or my private fault, I had not started using tags for the garden. I realised as more permanent notes are pouring adding tags in the front matter will be of use in the future for organisation as well for migrating the notes to my own jekyll based theme.

- **September 5, 2021: Flexible Atomicity**
	Slightly relaxed the idea that all notes has to be Atomic is nature. Two reasons to do this:
	1. To make the garden more useful for people other than me
	2. Some sub-ideas aren't that expansive enough to warrant an individual note for them.
	(Note: if the sub-ideas do grow in future they will have their own note)
	
- **September 3, 2021 : Reverse Zettelkasten**
	Zettelkasten is a result of long term effort. Until you hit the critical mass, there isn't much output you can derive from a Zettelkasten. While I want to grow my collection of permanent notes, I don't want to wait till it reach a critical mass to start producing content. Right now, I am making articles on a weekly basis for my [blog](https://blog.rahulrajeev.net). I do take forms of literature notes and project notes to collect the information necessary to make my articles. I have made the decision to convert items from my project notes as permanent notes (making it atomic and contextual). That way I can grow my Zettelkasten for the long term without sacrificing on my short term writing projects. 
	
- **September 1, 2021 : Created the Change Log**
	Overview till date: I started the digital garden as a place to share my permanent notes in a public space. The first approach was to write every thing in my private system and then export the notes that I have tagged there as "permanent notes" to here. 
	But this approach wasn't so intuitive and soon proved to be too cumbersome as it became difficult to process updates to existing notes and the amount of reformatting it took to make the text readable inside a website framework.
	Right now I am working on emulating a real Zettelkasten digitally by adding the permanent notes directly here based on contexts to which it can be added.
