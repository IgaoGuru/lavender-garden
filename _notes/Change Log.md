## What is this?
Change Log's function is to document how I have changed my approach towards using this public Zettelkasten system.

- **September 3, 2021 : Reverse Zettelkasten**
	Zettelkasten is a result of long term effort. Until you hit the critical mass, there isn't much output you can derive from a Zettelkasten. While I want to grow my collection of permanent notes, I don't want to wait till it reach a critical mass to start producing content. Right now, I am making articles on a weekly basis for my [blog](https://blog.rahulrajeev.net). I do take forms of literature notes and project notes to collect the information necessary to make my articles. I have made the decision to convert items from my project notes as permanent notes (making it atomic and contextual). That way I can grow my Zettelkasten for the long term without sacrificing on my short term writing projects. 
	
- **September 1, 2021 : Created the Change Log**
	Overview till date: I started the digital garden as a place to share my permanent notes in a public space. The first approach was to write every thing in my private system and then export the notes that I have tagged there as "permanent notes" to here. 
	But this approach wasn't so intuitive and soon proved to be too cumbersome as it became difficult to process updates to existing notes and the amount of reformatting it took to make the text readable inside a website framework.
	Right now I am working on emulating a real zettelkasten digitally by adding the permanent notes directly here based on contexts to which it can be added.
