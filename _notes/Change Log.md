## What is this?
Change Log's function is to document how I have changed my approach towards using this public Zettelkasten system.

### Sep 1, 2021 : Created the Change Log
Overview till date: I started the digital garden as a place to share my permanent notes in a public space. The first approach was to write every thing in my private system and then export the notes that I have tagged there as "permanent notes" to here. 
But this approach wasn't so intuitive and soon proved to be too cumbersome as it became difficult to process updates to existing notes and the amount of reformatting it took to make the text readable inside a website framework.
Right now I am working on emulating a real zettelkasten digitally by adding the permanent notes directly here based on contexts to which it can be added.
