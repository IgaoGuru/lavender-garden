What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.

It is piece of code or software that allows two applications to talk to each other. A simple example would be that an API allows one app to use the data that's held by another app.

 It is a piece of software that delivers an outcome that users want, but is held by two separate apps. API reduces the friction in communication between those two seperate apps.
