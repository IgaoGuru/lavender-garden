Title: What is first principle thinking
tags:  Inbox
---

The simplest way to explain what first principles thinking would be to define it as a framework that bases your thinking on what is true. [[First Principles]] are what is true and what can rely completely on without needing to assume or rely on anecdotes.

In this [[Mental Model]] for thinking you must strip away elements of the problem to reach its bare bones and then start to find your solution from there.  It is about diving deep beyond the shallowness of the surface.

To think from first principles, you must [[establish the first principles]] first.

Once you figure out what the first principles are, you can then use them to understand what is actually happening, free of assumption and then base your decision on those principles.
