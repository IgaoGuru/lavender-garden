title: Why should I write a book
---

  The first thing that jumps to my mind when I think about this topic is that I have always found the book uber-cool and anyone writes as super awesome, so hell yeah I wanna be super awesome as well.

Books are probably a detailed account of what you were at a particular age.  And it doesn't mean you have to write about your personal memories in a book, whatever you write about, will reflect who you were at that point in time.

I am a big fan of learning and I always look for methods upon which  I can improve the rate at which I can learn and comprehend new information. A progressive collection of learning on one particular topic eventually makes you an expert in it. And the best way for you to solidify your own breadth of knowledge is to write a book on a particular topic. By the time you write a book, you will apply some of the knowledge you have got, making it into pure wisdom.

It is the perfect way to share what you have learned. Yeah, videos are great, but videos are fast and go like a blink even to the keenest of observers. So when a person decides to dive deeply he ultimately will need to read a book about it. 

Book clarifies your thinking. Whenever you are writing about something you are forced to address some blank pages in your understanding of the concept. Furthermore, to complete the writing you will have to look for additional resources that expand your knowledge base even more.

It's so easy to write. Perhaps it is the most portable hobby you can practice.
