title: How to navigate through this garden
---

Now that is a question that I can only partially answer. I don't want to limit how you explore my notebook, you can start anywhere and jump to anywhere you like. 

  

Here is a short guide to get you started:

1. **Two types of Internal links are there**: [[Active]] and [[Inactive]]. The *Active Link*gets highlighted with a shade of light blue. It will take you to an existing note. *Inactive links* are there will grey highlights because these are links to which I will probably make a note in future.

2. **Link previews**: When you hover over an *Active Link* it will show a preview of the content of the note in a floating window (helps you decide whether you want to explore that note).Â  *Inactive links* will give you a question mark icon on hover to show the note isn't here yet.

3. **Back Links**: This is the most useful feature in this garden. When you are inside a note, on the right side of your page it will show you all the notes that have this note mentioned with some preview content. You may enter a note from one context, but backlinks show a different context in which the same note was used. This sort of contextual switch from the same content is why I like calling my **Zettelgarden** an organised mystery.

4. **The powerful graph**: The interactive graphs in the bottom section shows all existing notes in their interconnected glory. You can navigate by clicking any of the nodes in the graph (*Each node is a note*). You can locate the current note you are in, by looking for a slightly larger black colored node in the graph.

I hope this is helpful to you. It takes a while for the garden to grow and populate with notes. Things will make much more sense when it gets as organic as possible.



Go to [[Starts Here]] Or jump straight to the [[Home Note]]
