description: A brief note why this digital garden exisits.
---

My digital garden or the "Zettelgarden" is a byproduct of the amalgamation of two concepts that I am deeply passionate about - [[Zettelkasten]] and public [[Digital Garden]]s.

This website is an extension of [[my private Zettelkasten system]]. I use my own Zettelkasten framework that is built around logseq and Obsisan MD to process my thoughts, ideas, sparks, experiences and any other stuff that I am consciously attending to. The output of this system is two things:
1. A collection of permanent notes or evergreen notes 
2.Â  Source material for assembling the articles I write for [Thought Garden](https:blog.rahulrajeev.net/?utm_src=garden).

Permanent Notes doesn't mean they are permanent for all eternity. It just means that the notes will remain in my system, but will be subjected to changes. They will evolve constantly as I gather and discover new information that satisfies or invalidates the things I have written earlier.


The **main purpose** of the Zettelgarden is to be the public face of my Zettelkasten with hopes the "ideas in motion" can inspire more than the finished product. The finished product I speak of here is my blog. Zettelgarden serves as a snapshot of my process.

As for its **true purpose** it shall remain a mystery as I am yet to discover it.
