# What is interstitial journaling?

Interstitial journaling is a type of journaling that involves writing short entries throughout the day, rather than journaling at a specific time of day or writing longer entries all at once. The term "interstitial" refers to the spaces between things or the gaps between activities, and interstitial journaling involves using those gaps in time to jot down thoughts, experiences, and reflections.

While traditional journaling often involves sitting down for a dedicated period of time to write out one's thoughts and feelings, interstitial journaling is a more flexible and fluid approach. It can be done on the go, in short bursts, and without the need to set aside a specific block of time.

Some ways to incorporate interstitial journaling into your day might include:

- Writing down your thoughts and feelings during your morning coffee break
- Taking a few minutes to jot down anything significant that happens during the day
- Pausing for a few moments to reflect on your day before going to bed and writing down any important insights or reflections

The goal of interstitial journaling is to check in with yourself throughout the day and maintain a connection with your thoughts and emotions in real-time. This type of journaling can be especially helpful for people who have busy schedules, find it difficult to carve out time for traditional journaling, or prefer a more spontaneous and flexible approach to self-reflection.
