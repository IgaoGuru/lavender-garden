This page serves as the index note for all my thoughts, notes and workflows surrounding the notetaking/outline app called [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).

**Logseq** is an open source alternative to [[Roam Research]]. While it has all the benefits of [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) it based on markdown and is build as a local first app. Logseq can be run directly from the browser or as an app, using files stored locally or on a Github repo or from your favourite cloud storage service provider.

Since Logseq is markdown based  your files are never locked in. Logseq easily satisfies the necessary [[conditions for a good note taking system]]. And because it is markdown based, I can use it with [[Obsidian MD]]. I use the [[Combination of Obsidian and Logseq]] to manage my [[Literature Note]]s and [[Fleeting Note]]s.

Being a fully open source note taking app, you can [self host the entire app](https://github.com/dustinlacewell/logseq-guide) complete with the back end.

## Diving deep on logseq
Logseq is a free and open-source note-taking and outlining app that has quickly gained popularity as an alternative to Roam Research. One of the main advantages of Logseq is that it is based on Markdown, which makes it extremely flexible and customizable. Users can access Logseq directly from their web browser or as a standalone app, and it supports both local and cloud-based storage solutions.

Logseq's open-source nature means that users can self-host the entire app, which provides greater control over data privacy and security. Logseq also satisfies the necessary conditions for a good note-taking system, which include easy access to notes, clear organization, and the ability to find and retrieve information quickly.

One of the main ways in which Logseq sets itself apart from other note-taking apps is through its powerful query language. Users can use Logseq's query language to easily retrieve information, create collections of related notes, and build flexible workflows to manage information.

Logseq also includes other features that make it a versatile productivity tool, such as time tracking, task management, and the ability to create templates. Additionally, many Logseq users have developed plugins and integrations that expand the app's functionality further.

Due to its Markdown-based approach and open-source nature, Logseq works seamlessly with other Markdown-based apps like Obsidian MD. Users can easily integrate Logseq with other tools to create customized workflows that fit their specific needs.
