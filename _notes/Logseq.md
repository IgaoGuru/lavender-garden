This page serves as the index note for all my thoughts, notes and workflows surrounding the notetaking/outline app called [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).

**Logseq** is an open source alternative to [[Roam Research]]. While it has all the benefits of [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) it based on markdown and is build as a local first app. Logseq can be run directly from the browser or as an app, using files stored locally or on a Github repo or from your favourite cloud storage service provider.

Since Logseq is markdown based  your files are never locked in. Logseq easily satisfies the necessary [[conditions for a good note taking system]]. And because it is markdown based, I can use it with [[Obsidian MD]]. I use the [[Combination of Obsidian and Logseq]] to manage my [[Literature Note]]s and [[Fleeting Note]]s.

Being a fully open source note taking app, you can [self host the entire app](https://github.com/dustinlacewell/logseq-guide) complete with the back end.
