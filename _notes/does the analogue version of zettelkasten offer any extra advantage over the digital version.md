Title: does the analogue version of zettelkasten offer any extra advantage over the digital version

- To answer this question we begin by listing what is better in the digital version of a zettelkasten.
	- Digital takes away the limitations of analogues when it comes to ability of linking the same note to other notes infinite times
	- Similaryly the digital version doesn't have to worry about the length of text inside a page
	- Also it doesn't need a unique identifier

- But I am starting to see that these where never the real negatives in a analogue system.  The way I see it these where the strenth of the system.
- Using abstract numbers helps keep the zettels truly atomic and allow us to make more thoughtful decision regarding where might the note fit it.
