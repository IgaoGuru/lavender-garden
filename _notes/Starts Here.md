I am glad that you are here.

Thank you for taking the time to peek into my "Zettel Garden". I named it so by combining the words [[Zettelkasten]] and [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/). Zettelgarden is in a way a union of both these concepts (connected atomic notes and notes that grow over time).

As you might have noticed there isn't any strong enforced navigation hierarchies here. It's a conscious choice. Each page is a permanent note that I created.

You might find [[how to navigate this garden]] section useful if this is your first time entering a digital garden like this or you are not familiar using note taking apps such as Obsidian.

Up next is my [[Home Note]].
