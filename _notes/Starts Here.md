I am glad that you are here.

Thank you for taking the time to peek into my "garden".

As you might have noticed there is not proper indexing system in place here. It's a conscious choice. I don't plan to force any metal level top-down hierarchies here. In future, I might add some index notes here and there to keep the interconnected notes easily accessible.

You might find [[how to naviagte this garden]] section useful if this is your first time entering a digital garden like this.

 [[Book]] section will take you to the books I have read or am currently reading.
