Welcome to the start page. I am glad that you are here.

Thank you for taking the time to peek into my "ZettelGarden". I named it so by combining the words [[Zettelkasten]] and [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/). Zettelgarden is in a way a union of both these concepts (connected atomic notes and notes that grow over time).

As you might have noticed there isn't any enforced navigation hierarchies here. It's a conscious choice. Each page is a [[Permanent Note]] and you can jump to any note by the using the graph down below.

You might find [[How to navigate this garden]] section useful if this is your first time entering a digital garden such as this or if you are not familiar with using note taking apps such as Obsidian.

[[Home Note]] is living index page for this entire garden. You can explore to find more about what I am thinking and is learning through the [[Home Note]].

> **DISCLAIMER**
> This garden is a work in progress. You may stumble upon broken links, unedited text, invalidated hypotheses and many other things that you won't find in a regular blog. I see this more as a thinking space, using principles of Zettelkasten and applying the build in public movement.
