## A brief intro into 12 favourite problems.
It was Richard Feynman, the Nobel Winning physicist who said:
> _You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems_ **_constantly present in your mind_**_, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear a new trick or a new result,_ **_test it against each of your twelve problems_** _to see whether it helps. Every once in a while, there will be a hit, and people will say,_ **_‘How did he do it? He must be a genius!”_**


The general idea is create a map of your own curiousities, so that your mind always know what burning problems it is trying to solve. The 12 questions will act as the centre piece to your intellectual explorations, and to an extend keeps you grounded and focused in a widely distracting world.

If you can make your 12 favourite problems public, then it will attract like minded people to you, which is essential when you are solving complicated problems that may need multiple perspectives and expertise.

## My favourite 12 problems to solve for
Even though I have know about this concept for around two years now, I did not bother applying it for myself. I think I know the reason to that as well; I try to solve too many things at the same time. Too broad and grand are my projects and I feel like I have not completed anything to fullest to provide tangible benefits to the word or have'nt added anything to the collective human repository of knowledge.

So by trying to frame my 12 favourite problems here, I am trying to better focus myself and has a clearer vision of what I am searching for.
