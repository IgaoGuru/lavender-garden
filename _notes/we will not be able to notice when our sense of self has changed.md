We will not be able to perceive the changes in our own idea of the "self". It is called as the "Narrative Self" No matter how far fetched the changes are the self is the self that is present right now.

This is why patients with loss of memory, seems like a completely different person to us. They are the not the people who once we knew to be, but at the same time for there own sense of the self nothing has changed. 

A similar experience, can be created through write detailed journals of your life. When you read your journals from ten years ago, there is the slight possibility of you seeing how different your sense of the self was, all those years ago
