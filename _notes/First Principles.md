Before understanding what first principles thinking is we need to understand what does exactly a "First Principle" stand for?
First Principles
In mathematics, we have something called axioms. Axioms are truths that are universally accepted. They form the foundations of maths. 


First principles are like axioms. They stand on their own and cannot be created from other axioms. 

In other words, they can be seen as "foundational knowledge". 

In Aristotle's words "First Principles" are the basis from which a thing is known. 
The first principle for matter is an "Atom" according to the classical model of Physics.
First principles are truths. They are not assumed. It is what you get when you remove all that is unnecessary and distracting! It is free of all false beliefs and holds true under all conditions.
