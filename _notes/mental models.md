 Mental Models are characterisations of concepts that exist in the word that exists in our brain. One way to look at Mental Models is as the thing our brain creates (through reason or anecdotes or experiences) and uses to make sense of the world around us.
 
 We have all got our own mental model of various things. There are mental models that are universally agreed up on and there are one that are personal and unique.

 [[First Principles Thinking]] is a good place to start.

As always, this are not be taken at full face value. I am trying to condense and document my experiences as I am figuring different things out in my own terms.
