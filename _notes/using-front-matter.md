# Discovering Front Matter
[Front matter](https://frontmatter.codes/) is an amazing tool to manage this digital garden right from the vs code environment.


## Why Vs code?
In today's fast-paced world, information overload is a common phenomenon. Whether it's professional or personal life, people need to manage and process large amounts of data. Personal knowledge management (PKM) is a concept that helps individuals in organizing, managing, and accessing knowledge effectively. It involves various activities such as collecting, annotating, categorizing, and sharing knowledge. There are many tools available in the market to manage your PKM system, but in this blog post, we will discuss how you can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to manage your PKM system.

What is Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It's a lightweight and highly customizable editor that supports a wide range of programming languages. Besides coding, VS Code can also be used for other tasks such as markdown editing, task management, and debugging.

Why use VS Code for PKM?

VS Code has become a popular choice for managing PKM systems due to its flexibility, versatility, and the availability of numerous extensions. It can be used for various activities such as note-taking, organizing, and sharing information. Here are some reasons why you should use VS Code for your PKM system:

Markdown Support: VS Code has excellent support for Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. Markdown allows you to format text using simple syntax such as headings, lists, bold, and italics. With VS Code, you can create and edit Markdown files, preview them in real-time, and export them to other formats such as PDF or HTML.
Extension Ecosystem: VS Code has a vast extension ecosystem that allows you to customize the editor's functionality. There are many extensions available for PKM activities such as note-taking, knowledge graph, and knowledge sharing. These extensions can be installed with just a few clicks and can significantly improve your productivity.
Cross-Platform: VS Code is a cross-platform editor that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It means that you can use the same editor on different devices and operating systems, making it easy to access and manage your PKM system from anywhere.
Now that we have seen why VS Code is an excellent choice for managing your PKM system let's explore some of the ways to use it effectively.

Note-Taking:
Note-taking is a fundamental aspect of PKM, and VS Code is an excellent tool for it. You can use VS Code to create notes, organize them, and add tags for easy retrieval. Here are some tips to make the most out of VS Code for note-taking:

Use the Markdown syntax to format your notes. It makes them easy to read and edit.
Install the Markdown All in One extension to streamline your note-taking workflow. It provides shortcuts for formatting, table creation, and other features.
Use the built-in search function to find notes quickly. You can search by keyword, tag, or file name.
Create a separate folder for each topic or project to keep your notes organized.
Knowledge Graph:
A knowledge graph is a visual representation of the connections between different pieces of information. It's an excellent way to visualize your PKM system and explore relationships between different topics. You can use VS Code to create and manage your knowledge graph using the Graphviz extension. Here's how to get started:

Install the Graphviz extension from the VS Code marketplace.
Create a new file in your PKM folder and give it a .dot extension.
Use the Dot language to define the nodes and edges of your graph. You can find examples and tutorials online.
Use the Graphviz extension to preview and export your graph to different formats such as PDF or PNG.


## A qucik intro into Jamstack
AMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup stack) is a modern web development architecture that emphasizes building fast, secure, and scalable websites and web applications. The JAMstack approach involves separating the front-end and back-end components of a web application, using pre-built markup and templates, and relying on third-party APIs and services for dynamic functionality.

In a traditional web development approach, a web server generates HTML and CSS on the fly in response to client requests. This approach can lead to slow load times, high server costs, and security vulnerabilities. In contrast, JAMstack architecture relies on pre-built static assets that are served directly to the client without requiring server-side processing.

The key components of a JAMstack architecture include:

JavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to a website or web application. With JAMstack, JavaScript is used to build reusable components that can be used across multiple pages or applications.
APIs: APIs provide a way to access third-party services and data. JAMstack architecture relies on APIs for dynamic functionality such as user authentication, database integration, and real-time updates.
Markup: Markup refers to the HTML, CSS, and other static assets that make up a website or web application. JAMstack architecture uses pre-built markup templates and frameworks, such as Gatsby or Next.js, to generate static assets that can be served directly to the client.
JAMstack offers several benefits for web developers and website owners, including:

Faster performance: By serving pre-built static assets directly to the client, JAMstack sites can load faster and provide a better user experience.
Scalability: JAMstack sites can be easily scaled using content delivery networks (CDNs) and other cloud-based services, making it easy to handle spikes in traffic and growing user bases.
Security: JAMstack sites are less vulnerable to security threats because they rely on pre-built static assets rather than server-side processing.
Lower costs: JAMstack architecture can reduce server costs by eliminating the need for server-side processing and database management.
JAMstack is not suitable for all types of web applications. It works best for sites that are primarily content-driven, such as blogs, news sites, and e-commerce sites with a large catalog of products. JAMstack is also well-suited for building microsites, landing pages, and other smaller web applications.

In summary, JAMstack is a modern web development architecture that emphasizes pre-built markup and templates, APIs, and JavaScript to build fast, scalable, and secure web applications. By separating the front-end and back-end components of a web application, JAMstack architecture offers several benefits for web developers and website owners, including faster performance, scalability, security, and lower costs.


## Different Jamstack tools
There are a wide variety of JAMstack tools available, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here are some of the most popular tools used in the JAMstack space:

Static Site Generators: Static site generators (SSGs) are tools that generate pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served directly to the client. Some popular SSGs in the JAMstack space include Gatsby, Next.js, Hugo, Jekyll, and Nuxt.js.

Headless CMS: Headless content management systems (CMS) are tools that provide a way to manage content separately from the presentation layer. Headless CMSs are a popular choice for JAMstack sites because they allow for easy content management and integration with other services. Popular headless CMSs include Contentful, Strapi, and Sanity.

Front-end Frameworks: Front-end frameworks are libraries or tools that help developers build user interfaces for web applications. Some popular front-end frameworks used in JAMstack development include React, Vue.js, and Angular.

Serverless Functions: Serverless functions allow developers to write and deploy code without worrying about server management. Popular serverless function platforms used in JAMstack development include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Netlify Functions.

Authentication and Identity: Authentication and identity services provide a way to manage user authentication and authorization in JAMstack applications. Popular authentication and identity services include Auth0, Firebase Authentication, and Netlify Identity.

Deployment and Hosting: Deployment and hosting services provide a way to deploy and serve JAMstack sites and applications. Popular deployment and hosting services used in JAMstack development include Netlify, Vercel, AWS Amplify, and Firebase Hosting.

Static Site Search: Static site search tools allow developers to add search functionality to their JAMstack sites without relying on a server-side database. Popular static site search tools include Algolia, Lunr, and FlexSearch.

Build Tools: Build tools automate the process of building, testing, and deploying JAMstack applications. Popular build tools include Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel.

Monitoring and Analytics: Monitoring and analytics tools provide a way to track and analyze user behavior and application performance in JAMstack applications. Popular monitoring and analytics tools include Google Analytics, Sentry, and New Relic.

Design and Collaboration: Design and collaboration tools provide a way for teams to collaborate on design and development in JAMstack applications. Popular design and collaboration tools include Figma, Sketch, and InVision.

These are just a few of the many JAMstack tools available in the space. As the JAMstack continues to grow in popularity, it's likely that we will see even more tools and services emerge to support this modern web development architecture.
