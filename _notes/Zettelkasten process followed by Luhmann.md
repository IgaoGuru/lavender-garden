Title: Luhmann's Zettelkasten Process
Tags: Zettelkasten
--

It is crucial to understand how Luhmann used his Zettelkasten if we are to make his system our own.

While taking his notes Luhmann never copied what that is written by the author. He would take in an idea and look for ways to connect it with his existing notes in the system. These notes are called [[Permanent Note]]s.

He treats his Zettelkasten as a conversation partner. In his system, the notes are not limited or boxed-in based on their topic, they are addressed using purely abstract numbers. There was no top-down organisation of notes.
