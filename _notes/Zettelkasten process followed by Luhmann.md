It is crucial to understand how Luhmann used his Zettelkasten, if we are to make his system our own.

While taking his notes Luhmann never copied what that is written by the author. He would take in an  idea and the look for ways to connect it with his exisitng notes in the system. These notes are called [[Permanent Note]]s.

He treats his Zettelkasten as a conversation partner. In his system the notes are not limited or boxed in based on its topic, they are indexed as purely abstract numbers. There was top-down organisation of notes.
