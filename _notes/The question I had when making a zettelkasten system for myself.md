title: The question I had when making a zettelkasten system for myself
---

## What were the components of Luhmann's Zettelkasten System?
- **A Reference System to collect various references**
	- Reference Notes
		- Contains bibiliographical details of a book
		- It can also contain a breif summary of what the book is all about
	- Literature Notes
		- Notes written in response to the things you read
		- Written as phrases, taking it away from the context of the book
- **A Thinking system**
	- Fleeting Notes
		- A place to capture ideas that fly by through your head
		- A place to capture highlights from books and articles and other sources
	- Permanent Notes
		- Ideas that needs to be further explored
		- This can come either from literature notes or fleeting notes
- **A Creation system**
	- Project Notes
		- This is where you create your outlines
		- Perform the assembly of various permanent notes
		- Comparing and contrasting existing notes to develop your argument


### Questions
- What exactly is a fleeting note? How and when do you process a fleeting note?
- How does Sonke manages his bibliography? or reference notes/literature notes? How can it be implemented in roam and obsidian
- How to go about atomising the literature notes? Should the literature notes also exist as an atomic notes or the literature notes from a book goes to single larger file.
- When is a permanent note born?
### Current Assumptions
- Fleeting Notes are the ideas and bits that comes to you randomly and out of context and might have some potential solution to a question that you are seeking or perhaps start a new line of thought all together. It can be a question, a statement, a revelation or a piece of information
- Sonke uses Zotero. I haven't explored that option. For now I add the meta data for a book or others resources manually into the literature notes that I create. Luhmann's reference system does not seem to be atomic in nature. I think logically it is much easier to put all your literature notes from one source to a single page. I am yet to make that a habit as I pull from various sources at the same time. ( Incremental Reading). Roam, Obsidian and Logseq do give us the option to make it templates (for inserting meta data). I believe there are ways to integrate zotero into these apps. Will have to find out later.
- A permanent note is born when a literature note or a fleeting note has enough potential for you to explore and make a thread of sensible or reliable chain of thought/arguments.
