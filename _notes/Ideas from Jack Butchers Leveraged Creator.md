A collection of Jack's Ideas.

## 1.  Formula for Freedom
- Build marketable skills
- Earn more than you spend
- Don't depend on a single source of income
- Stop trading time for money
- Align your work with your curiousity
- Work when and where you want
- Develop a network of trusted relationships

Narrower the focus, the bigger the opportunity you have.
*Doing business on the internet is about convincing people you don't know that you have something they need or want. Think of a brand as the bridge between the two.*



## 2. Producing a result
No body cares about what you can do, they want to know what you can do for them.
Learn through experience.
Don't respond to the demand (_Investing our time to build skills that the market values until we're confident enough to sell them independently._)
Create the demand yourself. It takes years to acquire knowledge specific enough to be productized.

"If you're just getting started, you can do what I did **(get paid to learn on the job)**, or you can circumvent the market by building skills off the job **(get paid and learn on the side)**."


## 3. Abundance to you Scarce to others
When supply of something is constraint, it demand goes up.

*We undervalue what we assume is in high-supply (our proximity to our own skills and perspective often leads to an inaccurate evaluation of just how unique they are).*

World is huge and internet has connected it all. The viability of being rewarded for uniqueness has increased drastically.

## 4. Double Edged Swords

Internet has given us more leverage than any other tool in the history of mankind. It connects you a whole of lot of people, old and new, without any additional costs. That's almost magical.

People can use the internet to connect to each other just because they relate in terms of ideas and nothing else. This is not somethign that can be found even inside the circle of your personal connections.

Do the work and let the work find the people. -> Internet!

*"expecting the people that care about you to care as much about your obscure obsession as you do is lunacy."*


## 5. You are the most valuable asset in your portfolio

Reputation that you build is the proxy for your future earnings.
2 Elements of reputation: Ability (what can you do) and Reliability (What do you do).

Reliability is more important than ability. To build reliability you need proof of work.
Specific proof of work open new communications, new customers.

Everything you put online is an investment vehicle that generates equity when you take yourself to the market.
Without connection to the market, there is no equity.

*Your **equity** in the market represents the collective value assigned to you by people consuming your message*

Build value 80% of time, collect dividends 20% of the time.


## 6. Node Differentiation

Monopolies will win over time especially they are powerded by network effects.
As individuals how do we propel forward in an increasingly monopolistic world. The answer lies in differentiation.

Monopolies may be cover every thing, but they cannot be aggregate experience that is cross disciplinary.

"Technology democratizes consumption but consolidates production. The best in person in the world at anything, gets to do it for everyone." — Naval Ravikant

Individuals and corporations could be seen a network and the real question is why should a network connect with a node that is you. The answer to that question is where you find your work and where you provide value to others.


## 7.  Make yourself an [[API]]

Digital commerce is ever intensifying. Focus on finding the right advantage and pressing hard is the name of the game for most successful companies.

How does one maintain autonomy while capturing the upside this scenario has to offer?
In Jack's words *Your talent, perspective and unique output as a plug-and-play accelerant for another person, business or idea.*

So the idea here is behave like an [[API]]. Just like how an API has documentation that explain what it does, as an individual you have to publish your work, that demonstrates that you are able to solve real world problems.

Your goal should be to communicate as clear as possible about what you can do and how you can contribute in a world that is increasingly location independant. Skill deployment is no longer constricted by geography.

In the new world order the only things that will limit you is your ability to communicate what you can do/contribute.

## 8. Failure Insulation
The difference between an an employee and an entrepreneur? Their proximity to failure.

As an employee you can do bad work in a non-independent environment and be insulated from failure (and even told your work was good when it didn't work). The  skills you cultivate to excel in a non-independent environment are different than those required to excel independently.


## 9. If everyone has leverage, no one does!

*Having access to the tool does not equal having access to the result.* This is something I clearly see among some of clients. Seemingly they have every resource under the sun to create better work, but they fail to do it.

*If your goal is to build an independent internet business based on your talent alone, competing to be the most unique version of yourself is the underlying challenge.*

The challenge is  two-fold, building the ability to generate a result **and** finding a unique way to communicate it.

How to be better? It's quite simple, put yourself in a commercial environment that forces you build specific skill. Iterate rather than trying to innovate.

## 10. Build something
The objective is to build something unique around your mix of skills and experience, your journey will be unique - by definition.
