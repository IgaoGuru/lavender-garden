I believe Zettelkasten is something that we must personalize extensively to meet our individual goals. I decided that the only way for me to understand and create my own Zettelkasten was through trial and error method. I will document my learning insights and breakthroughs in the following thread: [[Zettelkasten]]


As I keep experimenting with the way I process information, I am frequently changing how I am using this digital garden.  The [[Change Log]] document significant mind shift changes and updates  regarding my process for managing the Zettel Garden.

I am also experimenting with various [[workflows]] to create an over arching Personal Knowledge Management System. There is a [[Budding Ground]] to serve as a place holder for notes that I find too hard to place in any of existing chain of notes. Then there are  are some [[assumptions]] and [[my favorite questions]] to seek answers for.

I  try to learn more and think deeply about  [[writing]], thinking, cognition, intelligence, decision making, mental models, learning, art and design.
