Home note will also change according to the way I think and organise the things here. But as meta-index page it holds everything together.


The fasted developing topic in this digital garden is [[Zettelkasten]].
 
 A Zettelkasten has to be something  personalized extensively to meet our end goals. This site is the direct result of my attempt at personalizing Zettelkasten. I am iterating on my process all most on a daily basis. So the [[Change Log]] exists to mark the serious mindset shifts and work flow adaption that has happened to my "Zettel Garden"
 

I am also experimenting with various [[workflows]] to create an over arching Personal Knowledge Management System. 


### Entry Points that exists now
- The  [[Budding Ground]] to serve as a place holder for notes that I find too hard to place in any of existing chain of notes. 
- Then there are  are some [[assumptions]] and [[my favorite questions]] to seek answers for.
- I  try to learn more and think deeply about  [[writing]], thinking, cognition, intelligence, decision making, [[mental models]], [[Learning]], art and design.
- The list of [[people]] who have inspired me, helped me, guided me and awed me with their work, insight and passion.
- [[Evergreen Articles]]
