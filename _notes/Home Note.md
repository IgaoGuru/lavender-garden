title: Home Note
---

Home note is were I try to keep things more or less organised. It is the meta-index page  that holds everything together. But it is also subjected to change depending on the information I consume and process.


The fasted developing topic in this digital garden is on [[Zettelkasten]]. This site is the direct result of my attempt at personalizing Zettelkasten. 
- I am iterating on my process all most on a daily basis. So the [[Change Log]] exists to mark the serious mindset shifts and work flow adaption that I have applied to "Zettelgarden".
 

### Other Entry Points that exists now
- The  [[Budding Ground]] to serve as a place holder for all the notes  ([[Orphan Notes]]) that I have a hard time finding a connection for. 
- Then there are  are some [[assumptions]] and [[my favorite questions]] to seek answers for.
- I  try to learn more and think deeply about  [[writing]], thinking, cognition, intelligence, [[Productivity]], decision making, [[mental models]], [[Learning]], art and design.
- The list of [[people]] who have inspired me, helped me, guided me and awed me with their work, insight and passion.
- [[Evergreen Articles]] contains links to some of the interesting articles that have I come across the web.
- I try to keep a record of the [[Book]]s I read as well.
