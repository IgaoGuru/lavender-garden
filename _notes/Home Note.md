Hey, Home note is were I try to keep things more or less organised. Here, I have created some entry points intro different topics and thoughts deliberately. It serves as a meta-index page to all notes in this personal knowledge management system. Do note that the home note will undergo changes with time, as I consume new information and change how I think about organsing the mental model of my digital garden.

## Topic wise entry points

- [[Design System]] - Inception, definition, future of Design systems 
- [[Zettelkasten]] - Comprehension, digital vs analogue, personalisation
- [[Productivity]] - Mindsets, Process, Approaches, End Game  
- [[Mental Models]] - Dissecting the classic mental models for my own comprehension
- [[Writing]] - Content, Copy, Persuasion, Strategy, Communication 
- [[Learning]] - Science, Methods and Optimisaitons 
- [[Knowledge Management]] - Information overload, how to manage information 


I would like to add topics such as art, design,  thinking, cognition, business, process, marketing, communication, intelligence, coding and decision making as I expand my reading and exposure to information.

All notes ([[Orphan Notes]]) that are yet to have assigned any starting points or topics can be found in the [[Budding Ground]]. You might also find my [[Book]] record interesting; these have helped me significantly shape my approach to living a life that promotes creation over consumption. I am also compiling a list of [[Evergreen Articles]] and [[People]] who have influenced me directly or indirectly.

Finally, let me remind you that Zettelgarden is my pet project. I am trying to create a public version of my personal knowledge management system through a combination of various approaches that are followed by some of the most amazing people that I know through internet. The core motivation for this project remains the [[Zettelkasten]] system, I am constantly adopting the make up of this system to suit my own needs. I try to keep a [[Change Log]] for the site, so that I can document serious mindshift changes and work flow adaptations.
