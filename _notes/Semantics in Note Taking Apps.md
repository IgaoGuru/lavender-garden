When it comes to note taking, I see two powerful schools of thoughts. There might be different variation in the which the thought processes are applied. I would identify the two approaches as follows:
1. Tiago Forte Approach
2. The Zettelkasten Approach

The differences between the two comes down to a question of how semantics is enforced : Distributed Semantic Authority Vs Central Semantic Authority.

Authors declare semantic authority with in their domains with ease. But a frequent problem that comes in mismatch between authors semantics and reader's reality.

People can come up  with "ad-hoc proto semantics"to better fit with their current data. The challenge they have is when it comes to converging this data with their own pre-existing semantics.

Tiago's approach focuses heavily on "Semantic Pre-ordination"(Meta-semantic formalization), while Zettelkasten approach  thrives on Distributed Semantics (Ad-hoc semantic capture).
Apps such as [[Logseq]] and [[Roam Research]] helps deal with intersubjective semantic convergence.
