## Gartner on Metaverse
"The metaverse enables persistent, decentralized, collaborative, interoperable digital content that intersects with the physical worldâ€™s real-time, spatially organized and indexed content.

It is an example of a combinatorial trend in which a number of individually important, discrete and independently evolving trends and technologies interact with one another to give rise to another trend. The emerging, supporting technologies and trends include (but are not limited to) spatial computing and the spatial web; digital persistence; multientity environments; decentralization tech; high-speed, low-latency networking; sensing technologies; and AI applications."

Current iterations of a metaverse doesn't meet the criteria yet.
