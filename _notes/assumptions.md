title: Assumptions

This page exists to note down some of the recurring assumptions that I make as I try to apply reason. I hope this list will motivate me to explore the truth behind these assumptions so that I can stay away from avoidable mistakes when thinking about something.

1. The personal narrative we build for ourselves is significantly flawed. It has got both positive and negative outcomes. I assume it to be more negative. Our sense of who we are and what we are doing is not a reliable indicator unless we have externalised these ideas and use feedback loops to check for their validity.
