- What exactly is reality? I don't think I will the person that answers that question. But the general direction that science seems to be taking is that what we perceive as reality is a construct of our brain.
- It can be seen as a snapshot of what actually there is based on our ability to focus and consider for.
- Researcher [[Anil Seth]] writes "Perception happens through a continual process of prediction error minimisation", in his [[Book Being You]] .
- The input sources of our brain give it the information from the objective reality; the reality we experience through our brains is constantly verified and modulated by this information.
- The reality we observe is a conscious experience, and it is based on our perceptual expectations. Expectations are ingrained and subconscious for most of us. The vast majority of us has a shared expectation of what reality is. We agree on our hallucinations to create this shared reality.
- When the hallucinations doesn't match up, because of various brain conditions and idiosyncrasies, such people are called "delusional".
- **"We perceive the world not as it is, but as it is useful to us,‚Äù** Seth writes. We are more likely to perceive the things that we expect.
	- It has been known for a while that the brain works towards speed and efficiency. And this means a lot of information is "skipped".
	- I have a feeling this might be connected to [[Learning]] in the sense, that if you know what you are searching for inside a book, you are most susceptible to find it from it.
- The self could be an another perception, a controlled hallucination built up from an assemblage of perceptual best-guesses, prior beliefs and memories. The [[Self is also affected by how others perceive it]].
	- I  think [[we will not be able to notice when our sense of self has changed]].
