title: Zettelkasten as I understand it
---

A Zettelkasten system has two main components or two boxes - One is the Zettelkasten itself and the other is a Reference system. 

- **[[Reference System]]** contains [[Literature Note]]s and your references. It serves as the place where you manage all your references to keep track of the sources of your notes as the Zettelkasten grows in Size
- Zettelkasten will be the place where you keep only your [[Permanent Note]]s. It is important to maintain this separation. It is inside the Zettelkasten you do your thinking. This is your workshop where you at the ideas you have already collected, combining them to generate new ideas.
