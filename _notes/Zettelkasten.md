title: Zettelkasten
---
I am exploring Zettelkasten method quit deeply this year. This is the index note for the topic. 
In a Zettelkasten index notes act as entry point into a topic and lets explore into different ideas and thoughts you have on the topic. But then each note could diverge and connect with any other note in the system.

The best place to start is probably from [[What is a Zettelkasten]] or you can use the connections in the graph. If you quickly want to jump into the mechanics of Zettelkasten go to [[Understanding Zettelkasten]]. It is my attempt to codify Zettelkasten as how I understood it and is applying it.


1. [[who should use Zettelkasten for writing]]?
2. What is the purpose of a Zettelkasten ?
3. [[Zettelkasten is not easy]]
4. [[Problems of a Digital Zettelkasten]]

A Zettelkasten loses its value when notes are added to it indiscriminately.
