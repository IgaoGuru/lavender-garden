title: Zettelkasten

I have been trying to get my head around the whole idea of Zettelkasten now. Every week I think I feel like I have hit a breakthrough, but then I see some variation of what it is. So Zettelkasten is an enigma for me.

This note will serve as the index note that serves as entry point into the topic of zettelkasten.
There are some very common questions that we need to deal with before entering into the methods of Zettelkasten. 
Here is a list of questions to get things primed up:
1. [[What is a Zettelkasten]]?
2. [[who should use Zettelkasten for writing]]?
3. What is the purpose of a Zettelkasten ?
4. [[Zettelkasten is not easy]]
5. [[Problems of a Digital Zettelkasten]]

A Zettelkasten loses its value when notes are added to it indiscriminately.
