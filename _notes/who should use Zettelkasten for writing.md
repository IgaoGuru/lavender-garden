title: who should use Zettelkasten for writing
---
Zettelkasten is not for people who are looking to make quick results. It doesn't promise you unmatched productivity in the short term, not will it be optimal if you are writing towards an end goal.

Zettelkasten is insight driven and there is large amount of setting up period it needs to start being useful to you. A zettelkasten can be seen as thinking tool for yourself as your are trying to find answers to the questions you might have.

It is not a quick fix for your writing practise, but a serious tool of thought. And it is incomplete if you cannot make the commitment it is takes to read some thing then the take careful good quality, reusable notes.

Ideal use case is for researchers and academics who is handling large volume of information as they are conducting their research. The system allows them to break ideas away from their parent context, restructure itself into forms that make more sense to them and connect it to other ideas they have already collected.

Zettelkasten can also be used for general non-fiction writing to collect inputs from different sources and then reuse the same concepts creatively in different context.

Zettelkasten takes time, it takes more time than others because of the fact that it is a process that needs to have certain build up of notes to start delivering results. In other words if you are in a hurry to pump something out Zettelkasten is not the way. Similar to how Spaced Repetition is not for cramming right before the exam night.
