## TLDR
Inside a Zettlekasten, the [[Index Notes]] act as the entry point into a topic and from there it lets you dive into other ideas and thoughts you have on the topic. But then each note could diverge and connect with any other note in the system thus making it location or topic agnostic in a way.

## What is an index note?

Index notes allow a Zettelkasten system to become more organized and efficient in how it stores data. Index notes are used to categorize and organize information within a Zettelkasten.


As you create notes and the complexity of Zettelkasten increases, there should be a way to travel through the ideas and topics inside the Zettelkasten. Index notes helps you do that.
They are the entry point into a topic and from there, it allows you to explore and delve further into related topics.

Index notes are used to classify information within a Zettelkasten system. They allow for quick and easy access to related notes. 

This makes it easier to find related notes when you are looking for specific information. Index notes also help keep the system organized and up-to-date. By adding in new index notes whenever a new topic arises, the system remains organized and can be easily navigated.

Index notes are also used to link notes together within a Zettelkasten system. By using index notes, you can easily connect related notes and ideas to one another. This allows you to explore and dive deeper into a topic without having to search through all of your notes. 

Index notes can also be used to create a hierarchy of notes and organize them in a way that makes sense.
