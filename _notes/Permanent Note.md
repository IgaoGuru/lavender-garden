 A permanent note in a Zettelkasten is an idea or concept that is freed from its source and has meaning on its own. Permanent Notes are created by refining your existing [[Literature Note]]s and [[Fleeting Note]]s. Permanent Notes are similar to the "[Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)" concept used by [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/).
