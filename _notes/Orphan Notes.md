Orphan Notes are notes that are added to a [[Zettelkasten]] even though there does not exist a chain of thought to connect it with, at the time of its creation.

Orphan Notes is something only I use and it doesn't come along with public definitions of Zettelkasten. I got the idea from the "Orphans" feature in Obsidian MD's graph view.

I use Orphan Notes to develop chains of thought that are completely new and don't have a place in my Zettelkasten as of now. But because I find the idea resonating with me, I keep for future "Sense Making" by linking it to the [[Budding Ground]] section of my Zettelkasten.

Orphan Notes are one of the liberties and privileges I can use because of a [[Digital Zettelkasten]]
