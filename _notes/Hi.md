Hi, I am **Rahul Rajeev** this is my ** [[Digital Garden]]**. 

I am **writer** who loves to *draw*, *paint*, *design* and *code*. I also maintain a [blog](https://blog.rahulrajeev.net) and monthly newsletter - [Thought Palace](https://blog.rahulrajeev.net/#/portal) There is an [[About]] page to know more about me or visit [[Now]] page to know what I am working on now.

You must be wondering if I have a blog, [[what purpose does this garden serve]]?
Don't worry, this is not a traditional website. Have a quick overview of [[how to navigate though this garden]] or find out [[this site is]].
