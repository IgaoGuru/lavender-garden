Out of all the note-taking apps I have used [[Obsidian MD]] adorns the title of the "King". It is super portable, available for free, it has a strong community to support and cheer its development and a whopping number of plugins to shape it into anything that you want it to be. Being a local first markdown app makes it the fasted app out there and that was the original reason why I migrated from notion to Obsidian. *A quick note has to be quick, [[Notion]] makes me wait for a  quick note*

I got hooked on Obsidian thereafter because of its simply gorgeous graph view. Watching that graph grow became the reward and motivation for me to take more notes. Obsidian does the job 99.9999% of the time for me and it can in fact function on its own as a comprehensive, Zettelkasten cum Reference cum Project Management Tool.

But it was not Obsidian that helped me understand the beauty of Zettelkasten as a thinking system. I needed [[Roam Research]] to see the full extend of what a Zettelkasten can do, especially for my use case that is centred around a daily note. 30 days of free trial in Roam helped me set the goal for creating my own [[personal knowledge management system]]s.

Since [[Roam Research]] is too expensive and I don't need the multiplayer function, discovering [[Logseq]] was the next breakthrough for me. Logseq worked like Roam but keeps the file locally and uses markdown. It soon gave me the idea of using it in parallel with [[Obsidian MD]].

Suffix to say I got the best of both worlds from this combination.

Obsidian lets me visualise my notes, and help write long-form articles based on my existing notes. I use it to think, manage my digital garden (permanent notes) and emulate a physical zettelkasten on how I chain the notes using the graph as a reference to look at my existing connections.

I use Logseq for everything else. The outliner function makes it easy to just keep writing without being too hung up on how to organise the writing. Logseq simplifies the process more than Obsidian as you don't need to create new files every time to represent a new idea or thought.  Having the daily notes feature is also a lifesaver for me.

Another advantage I have started making use of very recently is the Logseq web app that runs from my local directory. Since it runs on a browser I get to use Grammarly inside logseq, greatly reducing the time I need to process each note.

Expect for outlining, daily notes and the web client, Obsidian can pretty much do everything that logseq can and it is faster. But why chose one over the other when you can have both?

The trade-in for most people is that you can't enforce a folder structure for Obsidian when you are using it in conjunction with Logseq.
