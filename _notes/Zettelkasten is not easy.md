Zettelkasten is a not a fix for all your writing problem. It takes a tremendous effort to go through the motions that is required for the upkeep of a Zettelkasten. I can say with sincerity that it is must easier to generate content for a blog post or an article with other note taking systems.

But if you are in this for the long term, with your interests teeming in multiple disciplines, I believe Zettelkasten is a worthwhile effort.
