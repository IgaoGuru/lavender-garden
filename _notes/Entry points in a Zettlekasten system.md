Title : Entry points in a Zettlekasten system
tags: Zettelkasten
---

- Links and atomic notes get all the glory when we discuss about a Zettelkasten. But a zettelkasten is nothing without its entry points.
- Entry points are notes (It can be called Index notes if you wish to follow Sonke's nomenclature) that serves as the window in a line of thought inside a zettelkasten
- For example, the entry point for the chain of thread that leads to this note is the [[Zettelkasten]] note.
- In [[Introduction into Luhmanns Zettelkasten-Thinking and its Technical Implementation]] it is said that the best place to put the entry points are places where new thought begins.
- You are supposed to use your hashtags in these notes, to ensure of future discoverability of your notes. The design of hashtags is also an important work in maintaining a zettelkasten and more importantly, hashtags have to be used sparingly.
- Entry points also serve as the way to quickly cross-check your zettelkasten system before adding a new note to all the places where it can be added.
- [[How did luhmann made this index notes]]? It is important to understand it. Because write here this can diverge into two lines of thinking:
	- [[Difference between good and bad tags]] to define and explore the use of tags inside Zettelkasten
	- Another question we can explore is [[does the analogue version of zettelkasten offer any extra advantage over the digital version]]?


*I believe this page is a good example to mark with a tag to show the new lines of thought evolving* But I don't know what tag to put here.
