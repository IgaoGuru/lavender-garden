Creation of this digital garden was never an arbitrary event for me. It was a result of a large number of smaller bite-size wins I has as I started walking towards a lifestyle that focused on reducing my consumption and increasing creation.

The Domino effect for me started when I watched [Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/) short but poignant [Skillshare class on productivity](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/How-to-Organise-your-Workflow-to-Maximise-Productivity/) . He had beaten out all the fluff from the delivery of the content that this was the only productivity video I ever managed to sit through from start to the end. His one video was enough for me to get in track.

It was around the same time when I discovered [Hiran](https://hiran.in/index.html) 's [digital garden](https://hiran.in/notes) thanks to his wonderful newsletter [this and that](https://hiran.substack.com/) . When I saw his garden, I was sold on the idea and I immediately started learning about git and Jekyll and in the three days I made my first Jekyll site forking his setup. This digital garden would not have existed if I had not seen Hiran's implementation. As a side note, I got hooked with UX Design thanks to him.

The third person in this list is [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/start-here/) the man behind [Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.co/) and [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) . I got introduced to him again thanks to Ali, and then Tiago's vision for an external structure to support your brain in this increasing information-overloaded world struck a chord with me. I was quick to adapt his PARA method for organising files. More importantly, it was through Tiago I was introduced to the work of Sonke Ahrens on Zettelkasten and the need for [Digital Fluency](https://digitalproductivity.coach/) in my life.
