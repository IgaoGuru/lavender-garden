Hey, I'm  [Rahul Rajeev](https://.rahulrajeev.net/).  

I am a writer who loves exploring the intersections between art, design, development and strategy. Over the course of the last six years, I have worked as a Content/Copy writer, Brand Strategist, led a Digital Marketing team, and served as a full-time research assistant and translator/interpreter to Dr [Kanta Kochhar-Lindgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kanta-kochhar-lindgren-19495943/) during her Fulbright Senior Research project in India, back in 2017. 

Currently, I am working as Head of Operations at [Dreamflakes](https://dreamflakes.io), spending my time building a world-class interdisciplinary team. As one of the co-founders of [Dreamflakes](https://dreamflakes.io), I am so proud to share that we are one of the world's first design companies to provide [[Design System]]-as-a-service.

When I am not working, I spend time reading about behavioural science, philosophy, branding and learning to [draw portraits](https://www.instagram.com/rdrawsstuff/) and create better user experiences across digital & physical spaces. I am also exploring "tools of thought" and "knowledge management system" quite religiously to manage my information diet in this age of over-information. I intend to record my explorations here in this digital garden and eventually publish it through my newsletter [Thought Palace](https://blog.rahulrajeev.net/#/portal/signup)

You can catch me through my [[Socials]] page, and there is also a [[Now]] page to know exacly what my current whereabouts are. If you wish to consult regarding Personal Knowledge Management or Branding/Design, reach out to me via this [form](https://www.dreamflakes.io/contact)
