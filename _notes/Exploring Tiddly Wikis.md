## What exactly is a Tiddly Wiki

If you think about the word wiki then you might think about Wikipedia first. It is no surprise since Wikipedia helped bring Wikipedia to public attention. Wikipedia is a web page that can be edited. This is a good tool for collaboration. Wikis need some digital plumbing and some careful handling. All these things are unnecessary for personal use. Although there is an option to install Desktop Wikis in Windows, they don't seem as accessible as many of us think. Enter TiddlyWiki, developed by UK software engineer Jeremy Ruston.

TiddlyWiki is the best option to do free and fast Roaming research online. It is a self-hosted service so it may seem a little harder to begin with. 

Tiddlywiki provides an easy way to take notes without coding. Those are 15 years! TiddlyWiki is a magical meta programmer. Creating an additional note will modify Tiddlieswiki itself. For example, I can write dynamic TiddlyWiki. Note that I can click on the TiddlyWiki button when I repeat something a few times. Its modular nature means you've got unlimited options to create what you want in TiddlyWiki. Tiddly Wiki can replace some paid, private note-making software you might currently have.

## The problem statement

Roam research is a pretty popular note-taking tool out there. It's very powerful and there is a large number of people who are using it all around the world, just search the hashtag roamcult on Twitter and you would know how strong the fanfare for the note-taking app is. 

But it comes under a subscription model and all your data is stored in the cloud. While it is convenient to have your data stored in the client, it is less convenient when you don't have a choice in it. You don't have the option to make your data truly private when working with Roam Research. To be honest, this problem is unavoidable if you are using any of the cloud-based note-taking apps like Evernote or craft.

## The solution - Tiddly Wiki

Tiddly Wiki is a self-hosted alternative to Roam Research and other similar note-taking apps. What is more appealing is the fact that Tiddly Wiki is a completely open-source platform.

## Tiddly Wiki - A deep dive

TiddlyWiki is almost 15 years old now! Yes, the tiddly wiki has been here all this time, even though it may be the first time you have heard such a name in the take-taking arena.

That is because Tiddly wiki was mostly used by programmers and developers who find themself taking a large number of notes all the time.

Tiddlywiki is known for something called Metaprogramming. Sounds cool right?

What meta-programming means is that when a new note is introduced into the note-taking system, it changes the behaviour of the entire Tiddlywiki within which the note is hosted.

Tiddlywiki is designed to be a modular note-taking solution; each note is treated as a module and different modules can be connected to each other.

## What is a tiddler?

Let us start off with the Tiddly Wiki website! Click here for a new TiddlyWiki website. Click on the green "Download empty" buttons to download TiddlyWiki.

Click this link in your browser. Your arrival at TiddlyWiki starts with a welcome screen. Give him a name (“Joy notes”) and leave out the subtitles as you see fit. It does not have to alter the default tiddler display when starting up.

## Things you should know as a new tiddler who is just getting started

1.  You can create links between notes in TiddlyWiki
2.  You can use completely different titles when linking to already existing notes.
3.  You can include the content of other notes directly inside your notes. But this is a restricted feature, as atomicity is an opinion that TiddlyWiki carries along with it as its product ethos.
4.  You can take quick notes in TiddlyWiki. It allows you to save your best ideas immediately.
5.  Tiddlywiki also supports the use of hashtags to organize your notes.

## Philosophy of Tiddlywiki
- Create interconnected notes.
- Notes should be atomic in nature. It means a note should only contain one idea at a time.
- Notes or tiddlers are expected to be taken in a non linear fashion.
