title: Reasoning from Analogy
---

As the name suggests, you are trying to reason some thing based on comparisons and conceptual models that might be partially correct, flawed or outright wrong.

This type of reasoning is not based on objective evidence but on anecdotal evidence. Most often the anecdotal evidence might be from a secondary or a tertiary source.

There are few ways to think about this:
- I know that Idea A works. I  know the idea A works because of the presence of the quirk "X" in it. So I assume if I add the quirk "X" to Idea B, Idea B should also work flawlessly.
- I have heard Idea A works because of quirk "X". On blind faith I try "X" on Idea B and it also works. Now I have anecdotal evidence for the effectiveness of "X". So I proceed to add quirk "X" to idea C with the expectation that it will work.

Reasoning from Analogy is what we do it most of the shared beliefs we have, as the effect is much clearer if you think about how superstitions work.
