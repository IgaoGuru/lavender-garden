title: What is a Zettelkasten

This itself is a controversial question. There are somethings people agree on. Some they don't.
Let's start with what that is agreed in general.

A Zettelkasten is a personal information system and note taking system used by the German Social Science professor Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann was a very prolific writer and is considered to be a important social theorist of the 20th century. He has left behind a insight packed, high quality, body of work and attributes all his success as a scientist and an academic to his "Zettelkasten System".

Zettelkasten is a combination of two German words translating to the word Slip Box. Beyond this point different people describe the system on their on terms. I am also working on [[Understanding Zettelkasten]] more. Luhmann’s slip-box is currently the object of a long-term research project at the University of Bielefeld.[^2]

Zettelkasten can never be reduced as a simple note taking system. As Luhmann itself have noted[^3] that his Zettelkasten is his research partner and creating it is much harder than writing any book. This statement has to be taken at face value because he created all his interconnected notes physically with the marvel of modern computers. May be the analogue nature of his process is also a factor in the success of his Zettelkasten






### Interesting questions that rose while writing this
Is it possible to [[measure the success of a Zettelkasten]] system?
