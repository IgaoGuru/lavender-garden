Hi, I am Rahul Rajeev.

I am a writer who can draw, paint, design and code.

This is my digital garden! This is where all permanent notes from my personal Zettelkasten will end up. I am still in the process of working it all out. Currently I use a combination of obsidian and logseq to take my notes. 

In the mean time you can visit my [blog Thought Palace](https:/blog.rahulrajeev.net) to read my long form essays. There I am working towards the creation of a monthly newsletter. The idea behind all this is to have a robust "atomic" note taking system from which permanent or evergreen notes can be extracted here. These permanent notes will then further transform into the long form articles that I write in the blog.
