## Hi, I am **Rahul Rajeev** 
## This is my **Digital Garden**ðŸŒ±

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">The Mysteries of the garden <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Starts Here]]</span>
 </p>

<p>
    I am a writer who loves to draw, paint, design and code. I also maintain a <a href="(https://blog.rahulrajeev.net">blog</a> and a monthly newsletter - <a href="(https://blog.rahulrajeev.net/#/portal)">Thought Palace</a> There is an [[About]] page to know more about me or visit [[Now]] page to know what I am working on now.

    You must be wondering if I have a blog, [[what purpose does this garden serve]]?
    Don't worry, this is not a traditional website. Have a quick overview of [[how to navigate though this garden]] or find out [[this site is]].
