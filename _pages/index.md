# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  I suggest you start from the <span style="font-weight: bold">[[about]]</span> page to know whats happening here.
</p>

Rest of the content will be updated soon. Mean while I am leaving the template text as it is : [[your first note]].

<style>
  .wrapper {
    max-width: 46em;
  }
</style>
